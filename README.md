#### Problem Statement:

__RSVP Movies__ is an Indian film production company which has produced many super-hit movies. They have usually released movies for the Indian audience but for their next project, they are planning to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.

 

The production company wants to plan their every move analytically based on data and have approached you for help with this new project. You have been provided with the data of the movies that have been released in the past three years. You have to analyse the data set and draw meaningful insights that can help them start their new project. 

#### Project Overview:

You are a data analyst and an SQL expert. You have to use SQL to analyse the given data and give recommendations to RSVP Movies based on the insights. For your convenience, the entire analytics process has been divided into four segments, where each segment leads to significant insights from different combinations of tables. The questions in each segment with business objectives are written in the script given below. You have to write the solution code below every question and submit the same SQL script file with the solution in the 'Submission' segment.



 After analyzing the __IMDB__ dataset, we can draw some points based on the listed insights: 
 
• A total of __1078 movies__ were produced in the year 2019 in ‘Drama’ genre. Therefore, RSVP Movies should focus on ‘__Drama__’ genre for their next project.

• We can state that __Dream Warrior Pictures__ (Ranked 1st) or National Theatre Live (Ranked 2nd) or both could be their next project’s production company from the datatset. 

• As the average rating is higher in comaparative,, __James Mangold__ can be hired as the director for their next project. 

• Based on the median rating, __Mammootty__ (Ranked 1st) or __Mohanlal__ (Ranked 2nd) can be hired as the Actor for their next project. 

• Based on the total votes received and average rating, __Taapsee Pannu__ can be chosen as the actress for their next project.  

• __Vijay Sethupathi__ can be hired as the additional actor for their next project to provide a regional feel for the audience.
